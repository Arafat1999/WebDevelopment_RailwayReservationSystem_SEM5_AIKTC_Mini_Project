# WebDevelopment_RailwayReservationSystem_SEM5_AIKTC_Mini_Project
Created Mini Project on Railway Reservation System using PHP in Semester 5. In our Mini Project, Railway Reservation System we have stored all the information about the users booking tickets etc. This is helpful for the applications which facilitate passengers to book the train tickets, cancel the ticket, show ticket, and check PNR status of the ticket. We had considered the most important requirements only, many more features and details can be added to our project in order to obtain even more user friendly applications. These applications are already in progress and in future they can be upgraded and may become part of amazing technology.

Modules in the System:-
In Railway Reservation Management System we have implement different options
related to railway.

In this the user can book the tickets by just selecting the source, destination,
date of journey, tier, no of adults, childâ€™s after all credentials are filled we can now
